This Repository is an output from what i learned on jabar digital academy bootcamp that held on 2025 

to be noted i just learn about coding and want to be a programmer from scratch. i don't have any tech backgroudng even my bachelor degree i'll got soon is in education major 

In this Repository I will upload every type of code that I have learned like 
- function
- variable

- declare
- for loop
- if-else
- if
- recursion

Note
- also in this Repository i'm only allowed to upload it onmy github only 1 contribution per day
